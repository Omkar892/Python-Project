*** please run this project in jupyter note book ***

This Project for a calculating a age duration in various time units 
like Day, Months, Years, Hours, Minutes and Seconds . 
We can Calculate the age duration in different time units one by one.
This project are used .

(a) class SurvivalDurationCalculator: This class is responsible for calculating the duration based on the person's age and time unit.

(b) init method: Initializes the class with the age and defines conversion factors for months, weeks, days, etc.

(c) calculate_duration method: Accepts a time unit and calculates the survival duration based on the person's age.

(d) str method: Provides a string representation of the object (optional).

(e) Error Handling: Raises a ValueError if the user inputs an invalid time unit.

For defing a logic this project used a 
Months: 12 months in a year.

Weeks: 52 weeks in a year.

Days: 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years for simplicity).

Hours: 24 hours in a day.

Minutes: 60 minutes in an hour.

Seconds: 60 seconds in a minute.

     **Logic**
Input: Age in years.

Convert the age into the respective time unit:

Months = Age × 12 (months per year)

Weeks = Age × 52 (weeks per year)

Days = Age × 365 (days per year)

Hours = Days × 24 (hours per day)

Minutes = Hours × 60 (minutes per hour)

Seconds = Minutes × 60 (seconds per minute)

Output: Return the calculated values in the respective units.



When I was creating a project I had a so many problems for budling this project.
To, Creating a project I need to do lots of research on a project for calculating a survival duration,
to implement the logic on the project I was faced so much error I try my best for the solving error ,
and implementing a proper logic on program. this project have a so much limitations.
